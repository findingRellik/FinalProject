This program creates a course searching system, using a Binary Search Tree. The user will be able to search for a course by name, and view the teacher, department, time, and enrollment availability. The user will be able to add classes from the BST into their class schedule, which is stored as a vector. Additionally, the user may remove classes from their schedule if they choose. A class cannot be added if the class has reached capacity.
